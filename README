A Director class/module to be used with the impactjs game engine (http://impactjs.com/).
  This module essentially stores an array of levels which can be traveresed using different functions.


How to use:
Create a new folder called director: lib/game/director
Place the director.js file within that folder.
Within the main.js file, require: 'game.director.director'

Within game init, create a new director:
MyGame = ig.Game.extend({
	
  // Load a font
  font: new ig.Font( 'media/04b03.font.png' ),

  init: function() {
    ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.LEFT_ARROW, 'left' );
    ...
    this.myDirector = new ig.Director(this, [LevelMain,  LevelForest, LevelMountains]);
    ...
}

From here you can use this.myDirector (or whichever name you choose) to navigate through levels.

Examples:

  - Create a new director:
      this.myDirector = new ig.Director(this, [LevelMain,  LevelForest, LevelMountains]);
      //Initializes the Director. The first parameter is the actual game object.
      //The next parameter is an array of levels to include. This may also be 
      //initialized with a single level that is not within an array as in:
      //new ig.Director(this, LevelMain);.

  - Append additional levels:
      this.myDirector.append([LevelDesert, LevelVolcano]);
      //Adds additionals levels to the end of the array of levels. This will
      //also accept a single level not contained in an array.

  - Go to the next level:
      this.myDirector.nextLevel();
      //Note: this will return false if already at the end of the array of levels.

  - Go to the previous level:
      this.myDirector.previousLevel();
      //Note: this will return false if already at the begining of the array of levels.

  - Go directly to a level:
      this.myDirector.jumpTo(LevelMountains);
     //Note: this will return false if the level cannot be found.

  - Go to the first level:
      this.myDirector.firstLevel();

  - Go to the last level:
      this.myDirector.lastLevel();

  - Reload the current level:
      this.myDirector.reloadLevel();



***Note: for those using the latest dev version of impactjs, .loadLevelDeferred(data) can be used instead by making the appropriate change within the Director's .loadLevel(levelNumber) function.
